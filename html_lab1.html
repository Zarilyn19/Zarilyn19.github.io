  Hello world
  <script src="script.js"></script>
<h1>Before Beca </h1 
 <p>I used to go to Grant Avenue Elementary school so I been in this building for a while. When I was younger I went live in the Dominican Republic for 6 months and came back to the bronx. I also joined a dance class and took ballet and hip-hop classes.</p> 
  <h1>During Beca</h1> 
  <p>As a student I have changed and learned more. I have been here since middle school so I already got used to it. My favorite class was always ELA because it was the easiest subject in my opinion and I always got high grades in that class.</p>
  <h1>After Beca,</h1 
  <p></p>I would love to go to NYU I have been wanting to go to that college since I was young. In my own time I like to make music and I also create my own beats. When I get older I will like to become an artist.
